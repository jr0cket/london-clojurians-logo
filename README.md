Logo designs for the London Clojurian community.

Logo's developed using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), a free and open-source professional vector graphics editor for Linux, MacOSX and Windows.

## Design thoughts

The rough idea behind the design is that the outer blue circle represents the M25 surrounding a green and vibrant Greater London.  The lambda representing the major arteries (roads) through London.

Alternatively, the design represents a stylised clock-face of the clock that surrounds Big Ben bell in the Elizabeth Tower in London.
